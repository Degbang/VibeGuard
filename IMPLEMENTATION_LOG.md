# VibeGuard Implementation Log

Running, append-only history of deviations from CLAUDE.md's original plan.
See CLAUDE.md Section 8 for the rules governing this file. Where this log
and CLAUDE.md conflict, this log reflects current reality.

## [2026-07-10] - Project scaffolding and Python version pin
**What the plan said:** CLAUDE.md Section 6 specifies the approved directory
structure and Section 4/6 specify tooling (black, ruff, mypy, pytest) and
dependencies, without pinning a Python interpreter version.
**What we actually did / found:** The system default `python3` is 3.14.3
(via Homebrew), which is too new for reliable prebuilt wheels of
`shap`/`xgboost`/`scikit-learn` at the time of writing. Created the project
virtualenv against `pyenv`-managed Python 3.10.13 instead and pinned
`requires-python = ">=3.10,<3.11"` in `pyproject.toml`.
**Why:** Avoids build-from-source failures and version-compatibility
churn for the ML dependency stack (Layer 4) later in the project.
**Effect on thesis chapters:** Chapter 4 (implementation/environment
description) should state Python 3.10 as the target interpreter, not
"latest Python."
